## About The Project

This is a PERN web app that let's you record and track workouts in the gym. You can create your own workout routines or start a workout with an empty routine. 
You can create your own exercises or choose from a list of pre-made ones. The website can be found [here](https://workout-tracker-nzvi.onrender.com). 
The server spins down on inactivity, so it can take up to 50 seconds to register an account.
